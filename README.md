# SOC Internship at LetsDefend

This repository documents my progress and practical learning at **LetsDefend**, a cybersecurity training platform geared toward working in a **Security Operations Center (SOC)**.  
The goal of this project is to strengthen my skills in **detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents** by applying techniques and methodologies used in professional environments.
